# Building a Diversified Investment Portfolio with Data Science 
- In-house data science contest from [Data36.com](https://data36.com)

## Executive summary
- Investment experts often recommend that small investors build a well-diversified portfolio to mitigate risks. By diversifying, the impact of significant price fluctuations in individual assets or asset classes can be balanced by the performance of others.  
- In this project, the task was to download data for 20 financial instruments from **Yahoo Finance** and perform correlation analysis. The goal was to select four assets that exhibit minimal correlation with each other, thereby creating a well-diversified portfolio. 
- ⚠️ **Important Note:** This project aims to deepen Python programming and data analysis skills rather than to represent a viable investment strategy.

### Project status
- The project is successfully completed, but there are additional opportunities to improve portfolio efficiency, for example, by applying machine learning models.

### Data source
- **Yahoo Finance API:** [https://finance.yahoo.com/](https://finance.yahoo.com/)

### Methods used
- **Data Cleaning:** Preparing and organizing raw data for analysis.  
- **Data Table Construction:** Structuring the data for further analysis.  
- **Statistical Analysis:**  
- Data normalization to ensure uniform scales.  
- Correlation calculations to assess relationships between assets.  
- **Visualization:**
- Displaying a correlation matrix for better interpretability (using seaborn).  
- **API Integration:** Automating data retrieval from the Yahoo Finance API.  

### Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries Used:**  
- `yfinance`, `pandas`, `itertools`  
- `sklearn.cluster`, `plotly.express`  
- `seaborn`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `flynote`

### Project Results
- The analysis results and the selected portfolio are summarized in a presentation.
